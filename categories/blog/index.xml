I am pursuing a B.S. in Data Science and a B.A. in Disability Studies. I enjoy studying the relationship between disability, technology, and society. Upon completion of my undergraduate studies, I hope to find a career in data science that allows me to blend my skills from both of my fields of interest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, I promote disability advocacy on my campus through student organization Disability Student Union, which I co-founded. I am the recipient of the Patrica Murphy scholarship, which recognizes my passion for and commitment to disability justice. In my free time, I crochet, read, and make art.&lt;/p>
